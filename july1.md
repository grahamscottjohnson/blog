### polling app
- made a lot of progress, though I can tell I'm not using best practices because things keep breaking
- having issues signing in the user
- need more practice here so that this becomes natural

### bearAndSteady algorithm
- saw a really good approach to doing the algo
- wrote tests before doing code
- not good enough tests, wasn't sure how to properly guarantee performance in all circumstances
- still in pointer hell because should have used a real data structure with methods to keep track of pointers
