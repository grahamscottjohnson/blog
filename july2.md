### Functional Programming
- Really cool and different way to think about programming
- Learned about piping and currying and saw some haskell code
- Learned about pure functions in preparation for Redux
- Made an immutable linked list which was cool

### React Checkpoint
- easy, but wierd reading tests

### Algorithms
- sherlockAndCost is too hard
