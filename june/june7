Express.static doesn't look at parent directories.
Express doesn't load elements from the pages it loads (index.html good, index --> src = ../something.js) (but it can if ../ is still at expres.static)

mousedown is not a streamed event (it's not a while). when the mouse goes down, it fires once.
Read some YDKJS.
select is a cool html element
