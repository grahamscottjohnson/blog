Continued journeyToMoon
- fell into pointer hell, use a better data structure

Sockets
- world wide whiteboard
- hard to remember syntax
- concept makes sense. You can have sockets that constantly listen and emit events to interact with server/client more
- TCP connection is strong for server to send good data

YDKJS
- still reading about promises, and while i think i get them, i don't create my own promises, so hard to implement in my own code
- starting generators which seem really cool.
