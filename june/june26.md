Pillars Checkpoint was easy
    [*] learned you can increment stuff in sequelize
    [*] hooks are useful
    [*] get is not scary, its just a function called get
    [*] have to save things when making post/put requests

Tessel Hackathon
    [*] lots of goofing off wins I guess
    [*] Don't you dare clam up about communication. If you think someone is not contributing or is being misled, talk to them about it. Tell people your frustrations and they might be able to help you

Binary Search Tree / activity notifications algorithm
- I balanced the tree! lots of poor coding led to problems everywhere. console log helps
