Javascript 30
    [*] Flex tutorial
    [*] understood flex-basis a little better
    [*] nesting flexboxes is powerful (can center things super easy)
Osu Compiler
    [*] Have a better sense of what a parse tree should look like
    [*] realized I don't really need the data to be in a parse tree form since I'm not really trying to turn this into another language/string, I'm trying to use it in javascript, so a parse tree might not be a good data structure
Databases
    [*] learned how to store and select things
    [*] starting to understand joins, will need more practice
    [*] aliases and syntax of SQL is hard, will really need practice
    [*] Starting schema, I kind of get the importance of normalization
    [*] want to know how to hold a list of things and when that would be appropriate
