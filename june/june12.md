Javascript30 was easy with Array functions
node shell workshop was cool
    [*]learned about process.stdin and stdout
    [*]commands from command line are just functions from some program
    [*]node app.js runs program and terminal waits and interacts until program is finished
don't upload node_modules to git, the dependencies in package.json allow to npm install
learned that morgan is for logging
cleared up issue with Express next
Building still flooded :(
