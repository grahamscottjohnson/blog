CS - Saturday: Algorithms:
    [*] in Dynamic Programming, you don't have to hold all the things in a cache, only the ones you need,
        [*] For example, in fibinocci series, you only need to hold the last two in memory, not all of them
    [*] Auxillary data structures to keep track of visted/not
