Sequelize:
    [*] Sequelize is a nice library that makes SQL requests easier
    [*] needs to be installed and imported, then synced with database
    [*] might need to create database which you can do from sequelize
Wiki Project
    [*] Loren is a bad partner
    [*] learned a bit about routing and database setup
    [*] Good refresh on forms
Node/Express Checkpoint
    [*] didn't require database which is stupid since it was easy with javascript objects
    [*] some routing issues, make sure body parser is set up right ( app.use(bodyParser.json()) )
    [*] res.sendStatus(404); is good enough
    [*] need to learn how to handle query strings because if else statements seem bad
