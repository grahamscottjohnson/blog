Worked on Game of Life
    [*] read file from browser

## Week at a glance

Data Structures:
    [*] I feel good about these and want to try to incorporate them more into algorithms
DOM:
    [*] General things I understood, but it was really helpful to see dataset and table / tr/ td
CSS:
    [*] Flexbox works by analyzing remaining space
    [*] box-sizing is cool
    [*] calc and em are cool
