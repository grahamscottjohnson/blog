Activity Notifications algorithm
    [*] use of data structures quickly led to a plan to improve from n2 to nlogn code
    [*] median heap/binary tree is hard
    [*] balancing is hard, need to keep track of height, but I didn't see that for a long time

Tests
    [*] writing tests is hard. sure you can write a test to see that a tree is balanced, but that's not unit tests
    [*] how do you write tests for functions that don't exist yet and that you don't know you'll need?
        [*] plan, write broad scope tests for the plan, then plan the parts, and write tests for the steps to do each general task.
    [*] learn more chai

Trip Planner 2
    [*] practice more html to get used to option/select and stuff
    [*] break down functions into smaller functions.
    [*] Use redux for global state that's managed nicely.
