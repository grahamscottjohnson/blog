### React Design patterns
- shouldComponentUpdate
- componentDidUpdate
- props.children
- higher order components (wrapping components to give it additional methods/functionality)
- renderProps (passing in parameters into certain props to make it dynamic)

### Algorithms
- sherlockAndCost is too hard, gave up for now
- commonChild is tempting, but also hard
